    "The minucipality gave a tender to a perticular company.According to the aggrement the company is required to run a bus from \"source\" to a \"destination\" every 15 minutes on average.\n",
    "A minucipality wants to check whether the company is abiding by the terms of the agreement.\n",
    "It sends one of it employee to go to the bus stop and note the time it took for the bus to arrive at the stop.\n",
    "He is further instructed to inquire about the time when the last bus to that perticular location has left.\n",
